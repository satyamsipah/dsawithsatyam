A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

üóÇÔ∏è Common Types:
1) Array: Fixed-size list of elements.

2) Linked List: Elements (nodes) linked using pointers.

3) Stack: LIFO (Last In First Out).

4) Queue: FIFO (First In First Out).

5) Hash Table / HashMap: Key-value pairs for fast lookup.

6) Tree: Hierarchical structure (e.g., Binary Tree, BST).

7) Graph: Nodes connected by edges.

8) Heap: Special tree for priority-based tasks.

9) Trie: Efficient retrieval of strings.

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to perform a specific task or solve a problem.

üß† Common Algorithm Types:
1) Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search

2) Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort

3) Recursion: Solving a problem by calling itself

4) Dynamic Programming (DP): Breaking a problem into overlapping subproblems

5) Greedy Algorithms: Making locally optimal choices

6) Backtracking: Trying all possibilities (e.g., N-Queens)

7) Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim

8) Divide and Conquer: Splitting a problem and solving independently (e.g., Merge Sort)

üíº 3. Importance of DSA in Coding Interviews
Most top companies (like TCS, Infosys, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) test your DSA knowledge during coding interviews. They want to see:

1) Your problem-solving approach

1) Your code efficiency (Time and Space Complexity)

3) Logical thinking and optimization
